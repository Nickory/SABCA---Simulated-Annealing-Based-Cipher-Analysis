# SABCA - Simulated Annealing-Based Cipher Analysis
**SABCA** (Simulated Annealing-Based Cipher Analysis) is an advanced Python library designed for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. It combines **probabilistic language models**, **linguistic syntax analysis**, and **optimization techniques** like **simulated annealing** to provide a robust and automated solution for substitution cipher analysis. 

SABCA is implemented with a **graphical user interface (GUI)** and **command-line interface (CLI)** to ensure usability for both beginners and advanced users.
## üåü Features
- **Automated Cipher Cracking**:  
  Break monoalphabetic substitution ciphers using simulated annealing and statistical methods.
- **Encryption/Decryption**:  
  Encrypt plaintext or decrypt ciphertext using user-provided or randomly generated keys.
- **Real-Time Visualization**:  
  GUI includes live charts for decryption progress and fitness score optimization.
- **Performance Across Text Types**:  
  Works effectively on both structured (e.g., literature) and unstructured (e.g., technical) text.
- **Fully Open-Source**:  
  The full implementation, including a GUI, is open-sourced for reproducibility and educational purposes.
## üì¶ Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Libraries: `nltk`, `matplotlib`, `tkinter`

###  Select an option from the menu:
###     - Encrypt: Input plaintext and receive ciphertext with the key.
###     - Decrypt: Input ciphertext and a key to decrypt it.
###     - Crack: Automatically decrypt ciphertext without a key.
## üîç Experiment Details
### Objectives
1. Implement a monoalphabetic substitution cipher for encryption and decryption.
2. Demonstrate statistical vulnerabilities using letter frequency analysis.
3. Develop an automated cracking method using simulated annealing.
### Key Insights
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Successfully implemented a substitution mapping system for consistent encryption-decryption workflows.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Visualized plaintext and ciphertext letter frequency distributions to reveal encryption patterns and vulnerabilities.
- **Simulated Annealing Optimization**: Balanced computational efficiency and decryption accuracy using probabilistic language models and iterative refinement of mappings.
