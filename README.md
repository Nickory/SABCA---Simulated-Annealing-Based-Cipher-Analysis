# SABCA - Simulated Annealing-Based Cipher Analysis

**SABCA** (Simulated Annealing-Based Cipher Analysis) is a Python library for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking substitution ciphers. It implements a **novel automated cracking method** proposed by us, combining **quadgram statistical analysis**, **linguistic syntax modeling**, and **optimization-based simulated annealing**. SABCA provides both CLI and GUI interfaces for flexible and interactive use.
